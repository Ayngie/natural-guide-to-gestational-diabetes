# Your Natural Guide To Gestational Diabetes (GDM)

_UPDATE INFORMATION: This web application is being completely refactored for better structure, accessibility, aesthetics, and SEO (among other things). 
Link to refactored project will be released here when ready, so stay tuned!_

## Description
This is a Degree Project for Frontend Developer studies at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm (2022-2024).

### Overview
The *Natural Guide to Gestational Diabetes* is a web application crafted to provide users with a comprehensive resource for understanding and managing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) via a natural and holistic approach . Drawing from personal experiences and authoritative sources, this project aims to educate and empower individuals through accessible, user-friendly content. The app also includes a search function for retrieving the nutritional info of various foods. 

This application is built in React + TypeScript + Vite, with lazy loading.

The search info is dynamically retrieved from a JSON-file, the source of this nutritional information is Livsmedelsverket in Sweden.

The project language is swedish.

### Features
- **Educational Content**: Combines personal insights with research-backed information from reputable health organizations.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with HTML5 and Styled Components to ensure seamless usability across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Utilizes JavaScript/TypeScript for dynamic content delivery and enhanced user engagement.
- **Clean UI**: Structured with semantic HTML and styled with modern styling techniques for an intuitive user experience.

### Purpose
This project was developed to share knowledge gained from personal experience with gestational diabetes, supplemented by credible research, in a clean format that is both informative and easy to navigate. It serves as both a learning tool and a showcase of front-end web development skills.

### Future development
The project is prepared for implementing api-calls to: 
- Svenska Livsmedelsverket (LSV). However - for this a proxy-server is needed as api-calls from the frontend get access denied due to CORS.
- FoodCentral API (usda.gov) for adding the feature of searching info on foods in english.

## N.B.
### GitHub and SPA's:
As GitHub does not support SPA's (Single Page Applications) - if you refresh any of the 'subpages' (other than the startpage) you will get a 404 from GitHub. If this happens - to fix  this - please revisit the startpage and continue to navigate with help of the navbar (do not refresh the page deployed with GitHub Actions :).
